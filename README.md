## 1. Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the temperature trends for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop in Oahu should be open all year. W. Avy wants to ensure the business in sustainable by analyzing the summer and winter temperature patterns.

* December has a larger range in temperatures than the month of June.

## 3. Summary
### Additional Queries
In order to analyze temperature trends more in depth, I would write two queries that look at more than just once month. For example, I would compare the months June-August using the code: to the months of December-February. This will provide more data to better help contrast the summer and winter season temperatures. 
### Histograms
Also, I would look at the graphs of each month, using the code: june_temps_df.hist() and december_temps_df.hist(). It is better to visualize results than to simply look at statistics and numbers. I found that for each month, they share the same median and average, meaning the data follows a normal distribution and there are likely no outliers. This result is better shown visually.
